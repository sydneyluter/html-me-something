            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>Growing up, my family rarely ate at restaurants. Both of my parents introduced me to the joy of food and cooking from a very young age. My father was breakfast and grill-master (as many fathers are). My mother cooked most other meals from scratch, rotating through her recipe box which held my family's most beloved recipes.

            <h2>International Flavor</h2>
            <p>With family and friends from all over the world, I was exposed to the rich spices and flavors of Asia and the Middle East early on. After the first taste of curry, I developed a love for the way texture, temperature, consistency, and flavor all combine to create a complex piece of art. I started watching every food show I could, from America's Test Kitchen, to The Barefoot Contessa, to Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. I gleaned from those shows what technique I could and idolized the chefs and foodies they portrayed. My friends teased me for my obsession with Ina Garten (The Barefoot Contessa) and even bought me a signed cookbook of hers.

            <h2>Sous Chef</h2>
            <p>My mother always included me in her process. When I was too young to handle a knife, she'd yell out the ingredient she needed and I'd rush to the pantry to find it. Then, as I grew older, I played a larger part in meal preparation, and eventually sometimes cooking for my family on my own. Once I grew up and moved out, I enjoyed exploring new flavors and cuisines I never had before and tried more and more complex cooking techniques. Though I've had no formal training, cooking is a passion of mine. There is no greater feeling than creating a dish that fills the bellies of the people you love.
